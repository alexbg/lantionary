    <div class="collapsible-header">Why other desktop application like this?</div>
    <div class="collapsible-body"><p>
      I have used others like lantionary but sometimes I needed some features that
      they don't have or the way that are implemented can be improved.
    </p></div>

    <div class="collapsible-header">Why is it a desktop application and not a Web application?</div>
    <div class="collapsible-body"><p>
      Learn a languages is practice and store all what you learn, so keep all what you learnt offline
      is a need. Sometimes the web where you has been saving the words or notes has to close, and you can
      lost all, or you don't have internet but need to rememeber something...

  <li>
    <div class="collapsible-header">Where and how is saved the words, grammars, ...</div>
    <div class="collapsible-body"><p>
      The databases are in:</br>
      Linux: /home/username/.lantionary</br>
      Windows: still in development</br>

      Any data in lantionary is in files .json .
      I chosen json because can be read by a lot of languages and is easy to export and import, so you
      can use your saved words and grammar where you want.
      Anyway in the future there will be a way to export and import in an easy way.
    </p></div>

  <li>
    <div class="collapsible-header">I have found a issue, how can I tell you?</div>
    <div class="collapsible-body"><p>
      For now I am not accepting any issue or bug because is still under development, new bugs can appear and others
      can be solved, but when lantionary arrive the beta version then I will accept any bugs or issue you find and
      any request about new features.
    </p></div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <div class="collapsible-header">Is it free?</div>
    <div class="collapsible-body"><p>
      Yes lantionary is free, but if you want to help me, there are a donation button in the download part.
